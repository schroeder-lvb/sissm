       commands are available to the solo non-admin player.  Recommended use:  !map, and !maplist.  
       NOT recommended for any other commands including bot count/difficulty settings due to possibility for trolling.

        https://github.com/schroeder-lvb/sissm/blob/master/doc/example_Mapcycle.txt
    Added doc/example_Mapcycle.txt, doc/example_Mods.txt and doc/example_sissm.cfg files to github repo/quick-start package.

    ------------------------------------
    Internal changes:

    Increased poll rate of Insurgency.log tailing due to some maps spewing huge amounts of error/warnings
    Added alternate algorithm for determining current objective on 3rd party maps that are using non-compliant labeling
    Added time filter to prevent the "say" buffer from overflowing on faulty maps missing zone enter/exit hysteresis 

    ------------------------------------
    sissm.cfg changes:

    1) Please remove 'contact' and 'rules' from the macros table, add it to commands table to look like this:

        sissm.everyonecmds   "help version info ask prep warn rules contact"
        sissm.everyonemacros ""

    2) Added new !rules and !contacts commands/entries

        // When a player types !rules, these messages are shown on screen
        // with 'n' second interval (default 2).  Up to 5 lines can be
        // displayed.
        //
        picladmin.rulesInfo[0]  "1 Harrassment, racism, sexism prohibited"
        picladmin.rulesInfo[1]  "2 Hostile, lewd, immature behaviors prohibited"
        picladmin.rulesInfo[2]  "3 No rush, ask before blowing a cache"
        picladmin.rulesInfo[3]  "4 No rush, ask before breaching an objective"
        picladmin.rulesInfo[4]  "5 No rushing to objectives by yourself"
        picladmin.rulesIntervalSec  2   // #secs between rules lines are displayed

        // single line printed when a player types !contact.  This may be a web site,
        // clan name on a forum, or email
        //
        picladmin.contactInfo  "Find us at www.example.com"

    3) Added new a "low-players-alive (LMS)" antirush algorithm exemption

        piantirush.autoKickExemptLMS          2  // max # survivors to allow early capture
        piantirush.autoKickExemptMsg  "Early objective capture is AUTHORIZED NOW due to low survivors"

    4) Added filepath to Mapcycle.txt and allow "map" and "maplist" commands to moderators & higher

        sissm.mapcycleFilePath                  "/home/ins/iss/Insurgency/Config/Server/Mapcycle.txt"

        And append/allow "map" and "maplist" commands to moderators & higher:

        See 'example_sissm.cfg' for updates to: sissm.groupcmds[0], sissm.groupcmds[1], sissm.groupcmds[2]
        See 'example_Mapcycle.txt' for special formatting required for !map and !maplist commands

    5) Support for Circleus' Advanced Chat Mod color codes

        sissm.removeCodes       "<bold> <Red> <BLUE> <green> <yellow> <orange> <purple> <cyan> </>"

        When defined, SISSM will remove all above tags from the messages sent to the player console.  
        This is useful if you are running modded and unmodded servers but wish to share the 
        same/similar sissm.cfg file.  This way you may change SISSM text strings to include a color 
        code for your modded servers, and define 'removeCodes' for your unmodded servers.

    6) Optional pre/post-fix for greetings (connected/disconnected messages) for those looking to colorize player names.

        pigreetings.connectedPrefix         "'"    // player name prefix string for connect
        pigreetings.connectedPostfix        "'"    // player name postfix string for connect
        pigreetings.connectedAsAdminPrefix  "'"    // admin name prefix string for connect
        pigreetings.connectedAsAdminPostfix "'"    // admin name postfix string for connect
        pigreetings.disconnectedPrefix      "'"    // player/admin disconnect prefix string
        pigreetings.disconnectedPostfix     "'"    // player/admin disconnect postfix string
 
    7) Engine.ini changes - please include the following to your Engine.ini.  These are required for two
        features:  1) running MODDED maps that use non-standard objective labeling, 2) running anti-rush
        plugin that detects/displays/auto-kicks 'rush' players on Checkpoint/HardcoreCheckpoint.

    [Core.Log]
        LogGameplayEvents=Verbose
        LogDemo=Verbose
        LogObjectives=Verbose
        LogGameMode=Verbose
        LogNet=Verbose

     ---------------
     Konwn Issues/Bugs

     For WINE/Linux, SISSM fails to recognize admin command due to startup file sync.  It will
        "fix itself" over time.  Another workaround: you may also manually restart sissm.  This 
        seem to only happen when the server is cold-restarted.  Investigating.

     Circleus' Advanced Hud color option does not work with some third-party maps that 
       overrides the system HUD.  Since there is no way to detect this for automatic disable,
       a future SISSM plugin must be written to disable color for 'listed' maps known to override the HUD.

     Currently SISSM !map command does not support on-the-fly mutator change.  Most servers run specific
        and set mutator, but future SISSM command must be implemented if you want to change
        mutator sets "on the fly."

        b. Added code 'tap' to picladmin.reason[] - may not affect your community
        c. Added code 'xx' to pitacnomic.shorts[] - may not affect your community

    2. sissm_example.cfg new entries:
        a. pisoloplayer.defendTimer  90  // copy c/a defendTimer from Game.ini

    Starting Beta 02.2 the Quick-Package will no longer include the Windows DEBUG variants of sissm.exe.
    This is because the DEBUG version has consistently false-detected SISSM as a trojan.  If you need
    the DEBUG version, please compile it from the source, or contact me directly. 

Beta 02.1 (0.2.1) 20191219

    pidynbots: Added support for Soloenemies (coop instant respawn) by emulating
        min/maxenemies linear scaling (change bot count based on player#) as well as by
        adjustments per map, side, and objective.  For setup see doc/pidynbots 
        and follow Examples 1-4.
    picladmin: Added option to add "reason" for ban/banid/kick/kickid, either full text, 
        or by preset reason against rules
    sissm: Added segfault/stack-fault crash reporter with call-tree backtrace (Linux only)
        If SISSM crashes, please send the "sissm.cfg.crashreport" file.
    piwebgen can optionally read displayed server name from RCON
        To enable auto-read, set server name to "*" in pidwebgen module.
    piwebgen can now display any combination of 1) last/reason last rebooted (new), 2) time since last 
        rebooted with reason (new), and/or 3) time updated (legacy)
    See doc/sissm_example.cfg for latest onfiguration file 
    The "QuickStart" package will include two more Windows binaries: "sissm_dbg.exe" and 
        "sissm_restricted_dbg.exe."  Some Windows Server 2016 may not execute the optimized
        versions of sissm.exe.  However, the _dbg counterpart may trigger a false-positive 
        on your antivirus.

Beta 01.3 (0.1.3) 20191027

    This is a fast-turn bug hotfix release; also contains some experimental code
    No changes to the sissm.cfg (sissm_example.cfg) from Beta 01.2 - please update the binary only

    Fixed case sensitivity to !allowin name mask -- it is now case insensitive
    Fixed corrupted SessionID in sissm.log (extra CR at the end)
    Fixed a bug 'everyone' group could not execute picladmin commands allowed for 'everyone' in sissm.cfg

    Modifying core to now track game progress; updated piwebgen to reflect new data
    Piwebgen now shows map name on startup (no waiting for the map change after restart)

Beta 01.2 (0.1.2) 20191026

    Added "server nightly reboot" option (pirebooter)
    Added Event & web display of game Session ID to faciliate playback and delayed game monitoring
    Moved HTML tag filter from pigateway to piwebgen
    Fixed error in sissm_example.cfg ("macros" -> "execute" in privilege list)
    Macros are now directly executable (!x shotguns -> !shotguns), 
        You may, then, associate each with privilege level,  by group, including 'everyone' group
    Add 'unbanid' to admins command  - requires SteamID64 of the person you wish to unban
    !bs (bot scaled) command is now polymorphic.  Admins can type !bs [max] or !bs [min max]
        Example 1:  "!bs 40" sets scaling bot between botMinDefault to 40, 
        Example 2:  "!bs 6 40" sets the same range 6 to 40
    !bd (bot difficulty) is now floating point.  Instead of !bd 5 (defeault) you can say, e.g., !bd 5.234
    !bs and !bf now supports soloplayer mode (friendly bots/wave respawn checkpoint variant when 'bbots true')
    !ml and '!help list' now segments list output to 'say' box to support growing size of list
    !bs default minimumenemies, and max bots allowed by admin command can be changed in sissm.cfg (picladmin)
        Formerly these were hard-coded to 3 and 60, respectively
    New document: doc/sissm_advanced_macros.txt - create your own admin commands, assign privilege

    picladmin.botMinDefault 6               // 6 min bots (2 waves of 3 bots when single player)
 
    Please add 'unbanid' to existing sissm.groupcmds[0..5] if privileged for that group

1.  picladmin block:  Changed all default fun-responses to be shorter (fits on one line)

2.  Added bad words file path variable.  Simply add profanity words here, one word per line.
A (clean) example badwords.txt file is in the release package.  This is used to compare against
connecting player name.  If the bad-name plugin is enabled, the user is kicked.  To obtain
